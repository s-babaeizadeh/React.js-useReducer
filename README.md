<h1>React.js-useReducer</h1>
<p>The useReducer hook in React is a powerful tool for managing complex state logic in a component, particularly when combined with TypeScript for enhanced type safety. By defining a reducer function that takes the current state and an action as arguments, developers can create predictable state transitions that simplify debugging and improve maintainability. For instance, in a simple counter application, useReducer allows users to increment, decrement, or reset the count through clearly defined actions, making the state management process more organized and scalable. This approach not only centralizes logic but also leverages TypeScript's static typing, ensuring that state and actions are correctly structured, which ultimately leads to cleaner and more reliable code.</p>
